I build resource-efficient and secure intelligence for the Internet of Things. My research connects streaming anomaly detection, TinyML, and lifelong learning so embedded devices can adapt on the edge without sacrificing reliability.

## Research Focus

- IoT intelligence and security for cyber-physical systems
- Streaming anomaly detection and change point analysis
- Tiny machine learning for constrained devices
- Lifelong and continual learning pipelines
- Autonomous agents applied to embedded sensing

## Education
